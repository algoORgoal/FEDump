## WelcomeüñêÔ∏è

- This is a personal blog repository for my own use. I created this repo since I wasn't satisfied with the blog platform dev.to for the following reasons:

  1. You can't upload webp or gif to demonstrate how-to manuals.
  2. Viewers must sign up to dev.to to like or leave a comment. Github sign-in would have been better.
  3. The font looks ugly, especially the Korean one. It's hard to read for me.
  4. Ordered List Syntax breaks in dev.to. I always need to indent them.
  5. You cannot split a post into multiple sections with url fragments.
