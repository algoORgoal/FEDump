## Welcome🖐️

- This is a personal blog repository for my own use. I created this repo since I wasn't satisfied with the blog platform dev.to for the following reasons:

  1. You can't upload webp or gif to demonstrate how-to manuals.
  2. Viewers must sign up to dev.to to like or leave a comment. Github sign-in would have been better.
  3. The font looks ugly, especially the Korean one.

- Currently, I'm building a markdown editor so that I can really move my posts here.

## Tech stacks📚

- Next.js(Current I'm migrating off from Vite for better SEO)
- Typescript

## How to run🖥️
