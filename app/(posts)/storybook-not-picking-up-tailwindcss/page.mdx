## Description

1. You have a Next.js setup pre-configured by default.
2. You integrated Storybook with tailwindcss and next.js.
3. When you run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`, you can see `tailwindcss` is applied to your app.
4. However, when you `yarn storybook` or `npm run storybook`, you see `tailwindcss` is not applied to the stories.

If you went through all the things, maybe this post might give you some workaround.

## Workaround

1. Run the following command:

   ```
   yarn add autoprefixer --dev
   ```

2. Create `postcss.config.js` in your project root directory and type this in the file:

   ```js
   // esmodule config is not supported by Storybook

   module.exports = {
     plugins: {
       tailwindcss: {},
       autoprefixer: {},
     },
   };
   ```

3. Helpful Information

- Storybook picks up `tailwindcss` in these cases.
  1. There is only `postcss.config.js` in your project
  2. There are both `postcss.config.mjs` and `postcss.config.js` in your project
- Storybook doesn't pick up `tailwindcss` in this cases.
  1. There is only `postcss.config.mjs` in your project
