## What happened
A few days ago, I struggled to finish reading [Understanding React Server Components](https://vercel.com/blog/understanding-react-server-components) written by the Next.js team to get why Server Components came out, and what kind of problems they can solve. However, it was so long that I couldn't absorb the whole information. It's not the first time that I felt like this. A week ago, I got caught up in image optimization, and even [Image Optimization Chapter 
](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/images) in Next.js docs. It turns out that it's not only me who has difficulty reading long texts. The other day I complained to my friend and he was having the same problem

## We all know the problem
We all know to be good at something, you should get used to it. If you want to read faster, you should read well-written paragraphs. Unfortunately, we trained our brains to get information from short-form Instagram reels, YouTube shorts, and Reddit. How can you be good at reading when you don't read any book every month? That's me!

## Fewer Videos, More Books
I know that I'm bad at reading fast. I'm such a slow reader, and usually, it's not a big deal since nobody is demanding fast responses. For example, all the assignments are given several days due, and projects don't require me to read something fast, but this time it took me a whole day to read an article, and it sounds different now. I should work on it.

## Plans
Here are the plans that I made to come to the rescue of myself

1. Read books when you're on trains, buses and subways
2. Quit reading community posts and look into Wikipedia instead of other websites

Don't you feel any problem as I do? How much do you feel uncomfortable with reading? I want to hear your stories. Leave a comment below!
