## Requirements

Here are the requirements of the `<Toast/>` UI that I defined

- It should render regardless of routing. Some of them should render on button clicks while the others should render right after fetching.
- It should pop up for 3 seconds and disappear.
- It should be placed on top of everything. Nothing should override it.
- It should be placed inside the Box on the desktop devices.
- There should be different texts based on contexts, such as:
  - The upload has been canceled.
  - Contact has been saved successfully.
  - Your account has been deleted successfully.
  - You've signed out of Majorfolio successfully.
  - We'll send you a verification email.

## Restrictions

- It should be in the top-level component since it should render regardless of routing.
- It seems hard to place Toast in the right position. It gets worse since there can be multiple Toast Messages.

Therefore, I decided to look into some libraries, and React-Toastify caught my attention.

## What React-Toastify offers

React-Toasitify

- stacks notifications
- supports swipe to close
- pause toast when the window loses focus
- support nice and tidy default animations
- can display a react component inside the toast
- sets Toast with `role="alert"` for accessibility

## Positioning Problem

`<ToastContainer/>` was set with `position="bottom-center"` prop and it was positioned in the wrong position.
