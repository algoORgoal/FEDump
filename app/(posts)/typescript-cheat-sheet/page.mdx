### What is typescript?

A programming language with type systems on top of javascript

### Why do you need typescript?

- **Easy to catch mistakes by specifying types**
- Appropriate for enterprise applications
- **Applying OOP(Object-Oriented Programming) concepts such as interfaces and classes in your codebase**
- Makes it easier to understand your codebase
- Awesome tooling System

### Why don’t you need javascript?

- Learning overhead
- Compile to execute javascript code-it adds another step in the development process

## Best practices

### Use `unknown` type if you need `any`

- `unknown` forces you to narrow down types, so you can deal with the variable case by case, while `any` doesn’t give you any information about its type.

### Don’t use optional parameters in callbacks

- You can pass in functions with fewer arguments even if you don’t use optional parameters in callbacks
- Use it when you mean to explicitly write parameters.
